# Guard Rail Implementation Progress

## Summary
Implementation of guard rails to prevent unnecessary regeneration of expensive supplementary files in the YY notebook.

## Completed Guard Rails

### 1. Audio Schemas Guard Rail (IMPLEMENTED) âœ…
- **File:** `audio_schemas.json`
- **Cell ID:** `de65dfeb`
- **Location:** Lines around audio schema generation in YY notebook
- **Implementation:** Added `os.path.exists()` check with proper messaging
- **Pattern:**
  ```python
  if os.path.exists(schemas_json_path):
      print(f"[display] reading from disk: {schemas_json_path}")
  else:
      with open(schemas_json_path, 'w') as f:
          json.dump(all_schemas_json, f, indent=2)
      print(f"[saved] file: {schemas_json_path}")
  ```

## Guard Rails Still Needed

Based on timestamp analysis, these files still require protection:

### 2. Row Counts Guard Rail (PENDING)
- **File:** `row_counts.json`
- **Status:** Needs implementation
- **Impact:** Prevents expensive row counting operations

### 3. Schema Comparison Guard Rail (PENDING)
- **File:** `schema_comparison.png`
- **Status:** Needs implementation
- **Impact:** Prevents schema validation regeneration

### 4. Additional Files (TO BE IDENTIFIED)
- Other supplementary files that may be regenerating unnecessarily

## Implementation Method
Using Python script to directly modify notebook JSON structure with proper guard rail patterns matching existing 14 working implementations in ZZZ notebook.

## Next Steps
1. Implement row_counts.json guard rail
2. Implement schema_comparison.png guard rail
3. Identify and protect any other missing guard rails
4. Test that all guard rails work correctly
