- LPC_dataset_stats.csv
- Spec_dataset_stats.csv
- Mars_dataset_stats.csv
- merged_sample_data.csv
```

#### **Protected Visualization Artifacts**
All visualizations are saved with guard rail protection:

```python
# Guard rail protected visualization files:
- correlation_heatmap.png
- feature_distributions_boxplots.png
- feature_histograms.png
- dataset_feature_comparison.png
- statistical_summary_plots.png
```

#### **Supplementary Folder Integration**
- All artifacts automatically saved to supplementary folder
- Consistent naming convention for easy report integration
- CSV, JSON, and PNG formats for maximum compatibility
