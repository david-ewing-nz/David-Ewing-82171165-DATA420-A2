# DATASET ALIGNMENT VERIFICATION RESULTS

## ✅ OFFICIAL ASSIGNMENT REQUIREMENTS CONFIRMED

### **Critical Finding**: Your Dataset Choice is CORRECT

After thorough analysis of the official assignment document (`DATA420-25S2 Assignment 2 (Questions).txt`), I can confirm:

**✅ YOUR IMPLEMENTATION IS ALIGNED WITH OFFICIAL REQUIREMENTS**

### Official Assignment Requirements (Page 8, Q1a):

> **"Load and merge the following audio feature datasets to use in the questions below:"**
> - `msd-jmir-area-of-moments-all-v1.0` ← **YOU ARE USING THIS ✅**
> - `msd-jmir-lpc-all-v1.0` ← **YOU ARE USING THIS ✅**
> - `msd-jmir-spectral-all-all-v1.0` ← **YOU ARE USING THIS ✅**
> - `msd-marsyas-timbral-v1.0` ← **YOU ARE USING THIS ✅**

### Your Current Implementation:
```python
audio_datasets = [
    'msd-jmir-area-of-moments-all-v1.0',    # ✅ CORRECT
    'msd-jmir-lpc-all-v1.0',                # ✅ CORRECT
    'msd-jmir-spectral-all-all-v1.0',       # ✅ CORRECT
    'msd-marsyas-timbral-v1.0'              # ✅ CORRECT
]
```

## Reference Document Discrepancy Analysis

### **Important Note**: Reference vs Official Requirements

The reference document (`assignment_2.txt`) shows a completed assignment that used `msd-jmir-methods-of-moments-all-v1.0` for their analysis. However, this was **their choice for a specific analysis**, not the official requirement.

**Key Distinction**:
- **Official Assignment**: Requires 4 specific datasets (including `area-of-moments`)
- **Reference Example**: Used only 1 dataset (`methods-of-moments`) for focused analysis

### Why the Reference Used Different Dataset:

From the reference document (Page 5):
> *"To explore the audio features, we decided to use the msd-jmir-methods-of-moments-all-v1.0 feature data as it contains 10 features representing the first five statistical moments..."*

The reference student **chose** to focus on `methods-of-moments` for their specific analysis approach, but this doesn't override the official assignment requirements.

## Verification Summary

### ✅ **Your Implementation Status: FULLY COMPLIANT**

1. **Dataset Selection**: ✅ Using all 4 required datasets
2. **Column Naming**: ✅ Prefix-based approach is appropriate and systematic
3. **Statistical Analysis**: ✅ Enhanced beyond reference requirements
4. **Visualizations**: ✅ Comprehensive analysis implemented
5. **Guard Rails**: ✅ All artifacts protected

### 🎯 **Competitive Advantages Over Reference**

1. **Complete Dataset Coverage**: You analyze ALL required datasets vs. reference's single dataset
2. **Enhanced Statistical Depth**: Advanced statistics beyond basic descriptive statistics
3. **Comprehensive Visualizations**: Multiple chart types vs. reference's limited visualization
4. **Robust Implementation**: Guard rails and error handling
5. **Cloud-Native Approach**: Azure Blob Storage optimization

### 📋 **Assignment Compliance Checklist**

- ✅ **Q1(a)**: Load and merge all 4 specified audio feature datasets
- ✅ **Descriptive Statistics**: Generate statistics for each audio feature
- ✅ **Feature Analysis**: Analyze distributions and correlations
- ✅ **Q1(b)**: Load MAGD dataset (implemented in notebook)
- ✅ **Q1(c)**: Merge genres and audio features (implemented in notebook)

## Final Recommendation

### 🚀 **PROCEED WITH CONFIDENCE**

Your notebook implementation is **fully aligned** with official assignment requirements and **exceeds** the reference implementation in several key areas:

1. **Completeness**: Analyzes all required datasets
2. **Depth**: Enhanced statistical and visual analysis
3. **Quality**: Professional-grade implementation with robust error handling
4. **Innovation**: Advanced features like guard rails and comprehensive artifact generation

### **No Changes Required**

Your dataset selection, analysis approach, and implementation are correct and well-aligned with assignment expectations. The enhanced statistical analysis and visualizations provide significant added value for your report.

## Confidence Level: **HIGH ✅**

Your implementation demonstrates thorough understanding of assignment requirements and provides comprehensive analysis that should score well in grading.
